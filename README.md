# Skyline Editor
Simple online tool to generate Skyline visualizations, cf. Hermann Gottschewski,
Die Interpretation als Kunstwerk, Laaber 1996. ([example](http://fusehime.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gottschewski/doc/dissgraphics/Hauptgraphik3.JPG))

Takes time instants exported as CSV from Sonic Visualiser as input data and generates SVG.

**Example 1**
SKYLINE visualization of temporal processes in Edvard Griegs *Solveig's Song* based on an early performance
by Beatrice Kernic. The lower skyline represents the accompaniment, the upper skyline the voice.
